# What Google can do and You cannot do

## Google USM

## Internal noise dataset

# ðŸ’¡ Tips

## A layer number of an audio encoder for extracting audio feature

TBD

# ðŸ¤” Unclear points in the implementation

## 1. Parameter size

## 2. Upsampling method of USM feature

'nearest', 'linear'or 'bilinear' ?

## 3. Loss function of feature cleaner

The loss function for training feature cleaner is defined in the Miipher paper [2].
